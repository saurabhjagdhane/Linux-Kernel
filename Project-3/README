Steps to run the module:

1. Place the fork.c under YourExtractedKernel/kernel/
2. Place fbdheader.h in YourExtractedKernel/include/linux/
3. make modules of your kernel. (So that fbdheader is also linked).
4. make modules_install.
5. make install.
6. sudo reboot (Just to be on safer side) 
7. Place a makefile and myCode.c in a folder on desktop.
8. Make your module simply using make command.
9. insmod myCode.ko to insert module into kernel.
10. lsmod to make sure module has been inserted properly.
11. Now the fork bomb testcases can be performed as forkBombKiller module is present.
