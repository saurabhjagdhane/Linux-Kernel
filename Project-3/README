1. Implemented the kernel thread for detecting fork bombs (Spam forking processes).
2. Implemented the function of defusing a fork bomb within a kernel thread.
3. Implemented the synchronization mechanisms so that the kernel thread can go to sleep when there is no sign of a fork bomb and wake up when there is a possible bomb. 
4. Used kernel-level semaphores for synchronization.

Steps to run the module:

1. Place the fork.c under YourExtractedKernel/kernel/
2. Place fbdheader.h in YourExtractedKernel/include/linux/
3. make modules of your kernel. (So that fbdheader is also linked).
4. make modules_install.
5. make install.
6. sudo reboot (Just to be on safer side) 
7. Place a makefile and myCode.c in a folder on desktop.
8. Make your module simply using make command.
9. insmod myCode.ko to insert module into kernel.
10. lsmod to make sure module has been inserted properly.
11. Now the fork bomb testcases can be performed as forkBombKiller module is present.
